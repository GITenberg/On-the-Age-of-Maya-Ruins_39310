<p class="likeh2">ON THE AGE OF MAYA RUINS</p>

<p class="likeh3"><span class="smcap">By</span> CHARLES P. BOWDITCH</p>


<p>The inscription lately discovered in Chichen Itza by Edward H. Thompson,
United States Consul at Merida, is of more than passing interest. It
contains an Initial Series of glyphs, which, so far as I know, gives the
only initial date that has been found in the northern part of Yucatan.</p>

<p>Although it may be a matter of doubt on what date the long count
declared by the Initial Series began, yet, if we assume that the
majority of the initial dates refer to the time when the buildings or
stelæ on which the dates occur were erected (and this assumption seems
altogether probable), we can at least decide on the relative age of the
ruined cities in which the buildings or stelæ are found.</p>

<p>The great cycle glyph in the Chichen Itza date is somewhat injured, but
it is apparently of the same character as those found elsewhere. The
numbers of the cycle, katun, tun, and uinal periods are 10, 2, 9, and 1,
respectively. The number of the kin period is a face which, from the
circle of dots around the mouth, is pretty surely 9. The day number is 9
and the month number is 7. The day glyph is somewhat obscure, but
contains a circular frame supported by a knot, while the month glyph is
pretty surely Zac. We can then be sure of the following:?. 10. 2. 9.
1. ?, 9. ?. 7. ?., with the probability that the second ? should be replaced
by 9 and the last ? should be replaced by Zac. Assuming for the moment
that the great cycle sign is what Goodman calls 54, we find from the
tables that 54. 10. 2. 9. 0. 0. is 6 Ahau 18 Chen (49), and that 54. 10.
2. 9. 1. 0. is 13 Ahau 18 Yax (49). Now, in order to reach a day with
the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span> 9 and a month day with the number 7 from 13 Ahau 18 Yax, we
must add 9 days. This makes the date necessarily 54. 10. 2. 9. 1. 9., 9
Muluc 7 Zac (49). The day sign, though rubbed, has the characteristics
of Muluc, and the month is shown to be surely Zac; the kin number is
also proved to be 9.</p>

<p>There is just a possibility that the great cycle may not be 54. If it is
53, the date must be 9 Muluc 12 Muan; if it is 55, the date must be 9
Muluc 2 Yaxkin; but the month number is clearly 7, which eliminates both
these great cycle numbers. In order to find a great cycle with the
numbers ?. 10. 2. 9. 1. 9, 9. ?. 7. ?, we should have to go back or
forward from Great Cycle 54 at least five great cycles, which means over
25,000 years. This is such an enormous distance that it can practically
be thrown out of consideration, and we may be well satisfied that the
great cycle is really the same period in which almost every one of the
other dates occurs, viz., 54.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to compare this date with the first and last
known dates of the other ruined cities of Chiapas and Guatemala. I give
a list of these dates:</p>

<p>The above collation establishes the fact that Piedras Negras, Copan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
Palenque, and Quirigua flourished contemporaneously for at least a part
of their existence, for the last known date of Palenque is but 0. 11.
16, or less than one year before the first known date of Piedras Negras.
This does not necessarily mean that Palenque was deserted at the
establishment of Piedras Negras. Of course as investigation proceeds
other inscriptions may be discovered which may give earlier or later
dates, but it is interesting to note the relation between the known
dates of all these cities.</p>

<p>The date of Chichen Itza is later than any of the dates found above. The
following list shows the distance from the earliest and latest dates of
the ruined cities of Chiapas and Guatemala to the date recently found in
Chichen Itza.</p>

<p>The Book of Chilan Balam of Mani<a name="fnanchor_5_5" id="fnanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> states that on Katun 13 the people
whose history is recorded in this book reached Chacnouitan eighty years
after leaving Nonaual, and that on Katun 6 of the following cycle
Chichen Itza was discovered, and that on Katun 11 of the second
following cycle they removed to Chichen Itza, having remained at
Chacnouitan ninety-nine years. The distance from Katun 13 of one cycle
to Katun 6 of another is 200 tuns, or about 197 years. The distance from
Katun 13 of one cycle to Katun 11 of the second following cycle is 280
tuns or about 276 years.</p>

<p>The coincidences of dates are remarkable when it is seen that the length
of time from the first date of Piedras Negras to that of Chichen Itza is
278<small><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></small> tuns, while the time between the arrival at Chacnouitan to the
removal to Chichen Itza is given by the Book of Chilan Balam as 280
tuns. More than this, if an inscription should be found hereafter in
Piedras Negras recording a date as late as 54. 9. 13. 9. 6. 16, this
would show a stay in Piedras Negras of 99 tuns, the time given in the
manuscript for the stay at Chacnouitan, and if about 54. 9. 13. 9. 6.
16, the people of Piedras Negras deserted that city, they would have
passed 204 years and 73 days before arriving at Chichen Itza. Now, all
the historical dates of Quirigua lie between this last date and that of
their arrival at Chichen Itza. Could the people of Piedras Negras have
passed over to Quirigua and occupied that city during a part of this
period of 204 years?<a name="fnanchor_6_6" id="fnanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Such speculations may not be of great value, but if they excite enough
interest to induce a more thorough investigation, they will not be
absolutely useless.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
